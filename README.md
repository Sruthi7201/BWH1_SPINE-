# BWH1_SPINE-
Project for CS410

In this project, you will investigate the use of off-the-shelf game physics engines to perform kinematic modeling of the lower back. 
You will compare features, availability, support, and user feedback for multiple engines. You will select 2-4 promising game engines,
rig up a model of a single joint in the lower back (including two rigid vertebrae and the deformable disc between them) in each engine, 
and compare how well the game engines are able to model joint kinematics.
